Q1) In the file B-3.c, what values can variable `a' take? Will the `if' condition [a  < 4] ever be 
      true? Inspect the file B-3.c.*.vrp1 to analyze the dump.

A1)    The variable a can take values from 4 to 100. The condition [a < 4] will never become
        true. The code in the if branch is eliminated in the .vrp1 file.
