Q1) What will happen if "a = a + N" is replaced by "a = a + 1"?

A1)    I) If 1 is written in place of N, then loop unrolling doesn't take place, Directly the 
            value of a i.e 14 is returned. This is also true for local variables. If in place
            of N a local variable is written then loop unrolling won't take place. Direct the 
            value will be returned.
