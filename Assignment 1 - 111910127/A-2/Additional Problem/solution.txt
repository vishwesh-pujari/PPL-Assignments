Q) Try to figure out how GCC handles the ternary operator [a ? b : c] in GIMPLE.

A) Even if Ternary operator is written in the source code, compiler converts it into the
    corresponding if-else basic blocks and then evaluates it. In the end the control will reach
    the common basic block i.e. <bb 5> where the assignment of max will take place. The value
    will be stored in iftmp.0
